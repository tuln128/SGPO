# Steered Generation for Protein Optimization (SGPO)
![](figures/landscape.png)
Repository for protein fitness optimization by guiding the generations from discrete diffusion models using various pretrained priors and guidance strategies, or finetuning autoregressive language models. Accompanies the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15093) "Steering Generative Models with Experimental Data for Protein Fitness Optimization."

## Installation:
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml #transformers version 4.48.1 recommended
conda activate SGPO
pip install evodiff
pip install flash-attn
```
Processed MSA sequences (for training the prior) and fitness data (for guidance) for TrpB and CreiLOV are preloaded in this repo under `data`. Raw data, pretrained model checkpoints, and experimental outputs can be downloaded from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/jsunn-y/SGPO).

## Code Organization:
1. `APEXGo/`: code for reproducing the APEXGo baseline for latent space BO, based on the [original repository](https://github.com/Yimeng-Zeng/APEXGo/tree/main).
2. `configs/`: hydra config files for running experiments
3. `data/`: processed data files and code for data processing
4. `dataset/`: dataset objects for training value functions used in guidance
5. `exps/`: outputs from experiments, mainly generated sequences and associated fitness values
6. `models/`: diffusion models, denoising model architectures are provided in `models/pretraining/model/`
7. `oracle/`: oracle checkpoints for evaluating "ground truth" fitness and code for training and running the oracle
8. `sampling/`: code for inference-time sampling using various guidance algorithms
9. `scripts/`: shell scripts for running many experiments at once
10. `training/`: code for training the value functions used in guidance

## Model Pretraining:
Pretrained models are available on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/jsunn-y/SGPO) and can be copied over into `checkpoints`. Alternatively, commands used to run pretraining are provided in `scripts/run_pretraining.sh`. Pretraining should take less than 1 hour for each diffusion model and several hours for each language model on a single H100. 

Example command:
```
python pretrain.py pretrain_model={pretrain_model} data={data}
```
- pretrain_model = `continuous`, `continuous_ESM`, `d3pm`, `d3pm_finetune`, `udlm`, `mdlm`, `causalLM_finetune`
- data = `TrpB`, `CreiLOV`, `GB1`

## Unconditional Sampling:
Commands to sample unconditionally from a pretrained prior without guidance are provided in `scripts/run_prior_sample.sh`. These samples are only mutated at the positions under study in the case of TrpB. Each command should take minutes on a single H100.

Example command:
```
python prior_sample.py pretrained_ckpt={pretrain_model}/{data} data={data} model={model}
```
- data = `TrpB`, `CreiLOV`, `GB1`
  
Supported prior models:
| Model| `pretrain_model` (checkpoint name) | `model` (prior model type) | 
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------------:|
| Continuous | `continuous` | `continuous` |
| Continuous over ESM embeddings | `continuous_ESM` | `continuous` |
| Discrete D3PM | `d3pm` | `d3pm` |
| Discrete D3PM (finetuned from EvoDiff) | `d3pm_finetune` | `d3pm` |
| Discrete UDLM | `udlm` | `udlm` |
| Discrete MDLM | `mdlm` | `mdlm` |
| Autoregressive Language Model (finetuned from ProGen2-Small) | `causalLM_finetune` | `causalLM` |

Output will be saved under `exps`: 
- `generated.fasta` with generated sequences.
- `summary.csv` samples generated over multiple rounds and repeats, with associated fitness values. Serves as a baseline.

Alternatively, sampling raw sequences with no post processing can be accomplished with example commands found in `scripts/run_uncond_sample.sh`.

### Perplexity Calculation
```python perplexity_calculation.py```
Calculates the perplexities of unconditionally generated sequences using ProGen2-base. Output will be saved to `exps/protein/{data}/perplexity/perplexity.csv`.

## Guided Sampling:

Supported combinations of model and guidance strategy:
| Model| Guidance | `model` (prior model type) | `problem` (specifies how value function is trained) | `algorithm` (specifies sampling strategy) | 
|:---------:|:----------:|:----------------:|:------------:|:----------------:|
| Continuous | Classifier Guidance | `continuous` | `protein_classifier_continuous` |  `cls_guidance_continuous` |
| Continuous | DAPS | `continuous` | `protein_classifier_continuous` |  `daps_continuous` |
| Continuous | NOS | `continuous` | `protein_NOS_continuous` |  `NOS_continuous` |
| D3PM | Classifier Guidance | `d3pm` | `protein_classifier_discrete` |  `cls_guidance_discrete` |
| D3PM | DAPS | `d3pm` | `protein_classifier_discrete` |  `daps_discrete` |
| MDLM | Classifier Guidance | `mdlm` | `protein_classifier_discrete` |  `cls_guidance_discrete` |
| MDLM | DAPS | `mdlm` | `protein_classifier_discrete` |  `daps_discrete` |
| MDLM | NOS | `mldm` | `protein_NOS_discrete` |  `NOS_discrete` |
| Language Model | DPO | `causalLM` | `protein_DPO` |  `DPO` |

### Pareto Curve Experiment
Samples from guided generation, over multiple guidance strengths and multiple repeats, showing the tradeoff between having high diversity and high fitness. Example commands are given in `scripts/run_pareto.sh.` Each command should take less than one hour on a single H100.

Template command:
```
python pareto.py pretrained_ckpt={pretrain_model}/{data} data={data} model={model} problem={problem} algorithm={algorithm}
```

Output will be saved under `exps`:
 - `summary.csv` with generated sequences and associated fitness values.

Note: for NOS runs, if you would like to do a more extensive hyperparameter search, please use `pareto_NOS_hyperparameter.py` instead.
  
### Iterative Adaptive Optimization Experiment
Using a fixed guidance strength, simulates batch "Bayesian optimization" over multiple rounds of guidance. An ensemble of value functions models is trained between each round, and "Thompson sampling" is used to select a value function for guiding generated samples. Commands are given in `scripts/run_iterative.sh`. Each command should take less than one hour on a single H100.

Template command:
```
python iterativeBO.py pretrained_ckpt={pretrain_model}/{data} data={data} model={model} problem={problem} algorithm={algorithm}
```

Output will be saved under `exps`:
 - `summary.csv` with generated sequences and associated fitness values.
 - value function model weights will be saved in `exps/.../models`

## Data Processing:
The processed data and oracle models needed to run downstream experiments are preloaded to this repository, but processing from raw data can be reproduced following the instructions below.

### Data for pretraining priors
[Jackhmmer](https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/hmmer/tree/master) was used to search for homologous proteins and generate a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). The steps to perform the Jackhmmer search and process the outputs is provided in `data/hmmer_processing.ipynb`. The inputs to this model are (1) a parent sequence as a target and (2) all sequences in Uniref90 (December 2024). Jackhmmer outputs have been uploaded to [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/jsunn-y/SGPO).

### Fitness data
Raw fitness data were downloaded from the [CreiLOV](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.2c00662), [TrpB](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2400439121), and [GB1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982214012688) datasets, respectively, and have been uploaded to [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/jsunn-y/SGPO). These data were normalized and processed using the steps provided in `data/process_fitness.ipynb`.

### Oracle training:
Pretrained oracles are uploaded to `oracle/checkpoints`. Alternatively, oracle training can be reproduced with the command
```
python oracle/train_oracle.py
```
Visualizations for evaluating the oracle: `oracle_analysis.ipynb`

## Analysis and Visualization:
Outputs from the experiments demonstrated in our paper can be downloaded from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/jsunn-y/SGPO/tree/main) to replace the `exps` directory. Visualizations are provided in `analysis.ipynb`.

### Random baseline:
Generates random samples for downstream analysis.
```
python baseline_sample.py
```
